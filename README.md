### ENHANCING INVENTORY MANAGEMENT & SALES FORECASTING USING XGBOOST AND APRIORI MODELS.
Our project endeavors to enhance product placement in retail stores and predict sales through the utilization of data mining and machine learning methodologies. We have developed a Flask API to manage these processes efficiently.

By leveraging the Apriori algorithm, our system identifies associations between products based on transaction data, taking into account metrics like confidence and support. These associations guide specific arrangements, ensuring that frequently co-purchased items are strategically placed together, thereby improving customer convenience and potentially boosting sales.

Additionally, our system employs advanced forecasting techniques to predict sales for each item over the next two weeks. Using the XGBoost algorithm, we forecast the count of orders for the next day, providing valuable insights for inventory management and operational planning.

To assess the accuracy of our forecasts, we utilize appropriate performance measurements such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

By integrating data mining, machine learning, and performance evaluation, our project presents a comprehensive solution for optimizing product placement and sales forecasting in retail environments. This system holds promise for enhancing customer satisfaction, improving operational efficiency, and driving business growth in the retail sector.
